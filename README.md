# Stock-Price-Predictor-using-machine-learning
This machine learning project predicts stock prices using historical data. It starts with basic models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to identify market patterns, then advances to LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks for capturing time-series trends, seasonality, and deeper dependencies.
